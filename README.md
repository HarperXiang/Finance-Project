(We want to see if this is true): http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-illinois-legalize-marijuana-revenue-perspec-0504-20170503-story.html 

●	Research questions to answer:

●	Rough breakdown of tasks:
	-Everyone finds different types of data sources to research
	-Each individual picks their state to create a data frame 
	-As a group, use each of our data sets to compare to Illinois
